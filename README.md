# Homepage

This is my newly created browser homepage. Its purpose was to learn a bit of front end web dev (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), white keeping it simple and intuitive.

There are 4 search engines available:
 - DuckDuckGo (default)
 - Google
 - Ecosia
 - Yahoo

Open the settings at the bottom top and choose your preferred search engine.

## Live demo
Here's a [live demo](https://anic17.github.io/homepage) of the homepage. The homepage will be added soon as a browser extension.
